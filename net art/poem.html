<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_quail">quail</a> has been very popular to keep and breed for many years; numerous mutations have been developed. They are quite hardy once they have adjusted to their surroundings and keep the bottom of an aviary spotless. A great advantage of these quail is that they live exclusively on the ground, and do not interfere with other birds.</p>
<b>There are other types of quail.</b>
